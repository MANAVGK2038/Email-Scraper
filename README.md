# Email-Scraper
This tool scans the target to provide various links that are present on the html page of the target URL and it also crawls on other URL's that are present on the same page to output multiple email addresses that are fetched from these links. This tool requires you to specify the target's domain name in the mentioned way- https://<domain name>. This tool is coded entirely in Python. I recommend it to be run on a Linux environment (Kali Linux) for better, clearer output. Also works on other OS's.
