# Email-Scraper
This tool scans the target to provide various website links related to the target and also outputs multiple email addresses associated with the target once the scan is complete. This tool requires you to specify the target's domain name in the mentioned way- https://<domain name>. Have used Python to code the tool. I recommend it to be run on a Linux environment (Kali Linux) for better, clearer output. Works on other OS also.
